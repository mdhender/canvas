I'm almost to the point of creating layouts for lists and single posts.
Before I do, though, I want to clean up the posts that I've already completed.
<!--more-->

This means:

1. Removing the `draft` flag from the front matter.
1. Adding the `<!--more-->` line to manually break the summary.
1. Adding the "hugo" tag to all of the posts.
1. Creating the hand-written HTML from my first posts to Markdown.
